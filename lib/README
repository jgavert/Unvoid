Get glm like 


Windows dependencies

Get these files.

Latest glm should work.
http://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL2-devel-2.0.2-VC.zip
http://sourceforge.net/projects/glew/files/glew/1.10.0/glew-1.10.0-win32.zip/download

To get the pathing working correctly for visual studio:

- all the paths expect you to be in folder named "./lib". 
- unzip the contents of glm.zip to folder named "shared", should contain only a folder named 'glm'. Inside it there should be a folder named 'glm', there should be the .hpp files. Then it's correct.
- unzip SDL2 to folder named "win/SDL2", and below it you should find all the "include" and other directories.
- unzip glew to folder named "win/glew". The folder should contain "include" and "lib".

NOTICE

You might have to move the correct dlls to root folder "bin", to the directory that is specified in 'Solution' right click 'properties', 'Debugging' -> 'Working directory'.
Will provide a batch file to do this later...
