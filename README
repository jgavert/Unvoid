OpenGl project using newest opengl 4.x specification.

Opengl 4.1 it seems, either NVS 4200M doesnt support 4.2 or drivers don't...

I will not support opengl 3.0 for now because I'm not interested.

Goals:

Get used to OpenGl.
Become more proficient in c++.
Learn how to make GUI.
Learn Shade-fu.

And more...

DONE:

Copy someone elses code and get the initial program to build.
Run the program successfully.
Edit Makefile to build this project.

TODO:
Rewrite the Key code to look like my own.
Make a object that can be drawn.
Figure out how to import models and what format. ( OTL )
Something fun.
Particles!
Shaders!
Textures. ( OTL )
Image handler. ( OTL )

Note:
OTL = Man kneeling down with his hands on ground. Korean emoticon expressing desperation /disappointment. My feelings and excitment expressed towards the goal.
