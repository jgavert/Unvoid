#OpenGL project focusing on 4.x specification.

##Targets
	Experiment with multithreading in various tasks and study the effects of applying it.
	Physics! Very far off target.
	Machine Learning! Same as above. You got to have dreams, right?
	Making a game using this as a base.

##Features
	Can draw a multicolored and rotating cube.
	Works on Win/Linux!
	Ability to hack it in your favorite editor {project files for Visual Studio 2012 and sublime text2 with sublimeclang} 

##Controls
	Movement with wasd or arrow keys, and look with mouse. 
	Press '1' to grab mouse.
		  '2' to reload shaders.
		  '3' to toggle fps limit. 

##Building tips

	Linux
		packages for gl glu libpng
		Works best with the latest clang++ v3.2 or g++-4.7 (or greater versions of either)
		Graphics drivers are also needed.

	Windows
		Visual Studio 2012
		Visual C++ Compiler November 2012 CTP (dem c++11 features)

	OSX
		Not supported. 
		Why? Mainly because I will never willingly buy an apple computer.
		I guess OSX might be easier than I thought BUT YOU need to supply me with a free mac first.
