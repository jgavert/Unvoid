OpenGL project focusing on 4.x specification.
=============================================

Targets
-------
* Getting used to OpenGL development
* Experiment with multithreading in various tasks and study the effects of applying it.
* Physics! Very far off target.
* Machine Learning! Same as above. You got to have dreams, right?
* Making a game using this as a base.

Features
--------
* Can draw a multicolored and rotating cube.
* Works on Win/Linux!
* Ability to hack it in your favourite editor {project files for Visual Studio 2012 and sublime text2 with sublimeclang} 

Controls
--------
* Movement with 'wasd' or arrow keys, and look with mouse. 
* '1' to grab mouse.
* '2' to reload shaders.
* '3' to toggle fps limit. 
* '4' to toggle particles.
* '5' to toggle fullscreen. (careful on linux(nvidia+cinerama) sets the mode for the first screen and wont revert)
* '6' to toggle movement speed.

Building tips
-------------

<dl>
	<dt>Linux</dt>
	<dd>Packages for gl glu libpng.	
	    Works best with the latest clang++ v3.2 or g++-4.7 (or greater versions of either).
		Graphics drivers are also needed.</dd>

	<dt>Windows</dt>
	<dd>Visual Studio 2012,
		Visual C++ Compiler November 2012 CTP (dem c++11 features)</dd>

	<dt>OSX</dt>
	<dd>Not supported.	
		Why? Mainly because I will never willingly buy an apple computer.	
		I guess OSX might be easier than I thought BUT YOU need to supply me with a free mac first.</dd>
